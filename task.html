    <p><h3>Clear skies, calm winds and a panoramic view of Himalayan peaks drapein snow - that is the autumn hikers on Mount Everest have come to love.
But that seems to be changing.
The monsoon now stretches into autumn, the traditional season for mountain tourism, meteorologists say, making weather more unpredictable.
For the past decade, they have recorded at least one episode of extreme rainfall almost every year during the tail end of this longer monsoon - and in the mountains it is becoming quite dangerous.
Last weekend, a shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near the eastern face of Everest for days in freezing temperatures at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft).
Nearly 600 trekkers were guided to safety by the end of Tuesday, Chinese state media said. One person had died from hypothermia and altitude sickness, but the others were reportedly in good condition.</h3></p>
